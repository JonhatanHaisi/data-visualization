# Data Visualization Samples Repository
This repository was created to group a list of data visualizarion samples in python.

## The environment
These examples are using python with the libs bellow. You will need to install them to run the examples locally.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
You can find the jupyter documentation can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/).

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
You can find the matplotlib documentation can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/index.html).

## Numpy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
* a powerful N-dimensional array object
* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
